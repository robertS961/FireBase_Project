# AngIntro with Firebase Backend
The goal of This project was to create a successful operating login connected to a backend in Firebase. 
This was achieved and I experienced using pipelines in Angular.
My next goal is to hook this up to my completed front end Website for Morocco, Morocco, and Specht.
